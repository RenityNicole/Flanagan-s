This is the website of a Irish family whisky that was passed down to the Great grandson of Jacob Flanagan.
Flanagan's was created because Jacob felt that the liquor that was made wasn't strong, or pure enough for his Irish blood. 
So him and his brother worked endlessly to create perfection in a bottle. Flanagan's is 100% proof distilled Irish whisky. 
On the website you will see that the Flanagan family takes pride in their company. So they have provided a way for the "outsider",
as they call them. To take a indepth look into the brand.

They have an about me section that shows a small look into what the distilled alcohol looks like. 
Once it is out of the barrel. They also have a contact section allowing everyone to sign up for daily news and newsletters. 
At the moment the contact, and order section or down for construction as they are working to get the page to be interactive.
The website runs on Microsoft Edge so make sure that is the browser that you use.
